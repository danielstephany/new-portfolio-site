                    <h2>Fitsii</h2>
                    <p>Fitsii is a project that I designed to give myself a bit of practice using angluar.js. Fitsii is a single page web app that uses angulars router to change between different views and set the appropriate controller. I set up a mock database for angular to pull data from so that the information on each view can be dynamically generated using angulars $http service. I also used filtering and ordering in the list views to organize the data on the page. Along with this project I used gulp to handle my tasks and streamline my workflow by having it concat and minimize scripts, compile and minimize Sass, minify html, and place everything in a dist folder for distribution.</p>

                  <h2>Ritualforms</h2>
                  <p>Ritualforms.com is a mobile responsive Portfolio site I designed and built for a local Milwaukee tatoo artist and painter. My client wanted a very simple site that was easy to use, navigate, and post photos of his work on. The photos on this site are pulled from different galleries on flickr that he posts to from his instagram account. To get the images from flickr I used jQuery to perform an ajax call, then I filtered and posted the photos using javascript. I also added a light box effect that I coded with jQuery.</p>

                  <p>Stephanyswoodworking.com is a moble responsive site that I designed and built to provide basic information about stephanys wordworking and repair and show examples of there work. the main page is a static page that provides information about the company, their services , and a brief bio on the owners. I built a gallery page using jQuery and javascript that pulls photos from their Instagram account and post the picture and the description. I also used a lightbox effect for this gallery built with jQuery.</p>

                  <h2>Lyft clone</h2>
                  <p>The Lyft clone is a project that I built to stay sharp by reviewing the techniques that other developers used to build this site. I cloned it using my own techniques and then compared the differences between how I built it and how the original developers built it. I used jQuery for most of the interactive bits along with css transitions.</p>

                  <h2>Square clone</h2>
                  <p>I chose to clone a page of the square site mainly because I really liked their menu animation and the different states it had, it was a fun challenging component to build. I also really liked the clean UI. In this project I use jQuery and css for the transitions.</p>

                  <p>The Nest Store clone is a fully responsive copy of the Nest Store home page that does not link to other pages. I built this to sharpen my sass/css skills by studying and recreating the techniques of a seasoned developer.</p>
